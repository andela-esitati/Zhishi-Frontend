## Tags

Tags are really important to **zhishi** successfully matching questions and answers to user interests.

Different pages (and modal) display tags differently, depending on what the tags need to do.

This folder contains sub folders (homepage, question and modal) representing the respective views that use tags and the specific tag components they use.



### homepage

Contains tags used to filter the questions list on the homepage.


### question

The tag component in this folder shows directly beneath a question in the question show.


### modal

The modal displayed on the drop-down tag selection modal.

The modal effect is a higher order component, but while working on this tag component, you need not worry about that, since it adds no functionality. Only visual behavior.
